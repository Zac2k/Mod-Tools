### Setting Up a Map

After installing the Unity package, follow these steps to set up and export your map:

2. **Ensure Proper Collider Setup:**
   - Make sure your map has all necessary colliders set up correctly.

3. **Add the ModMapManager Prefab:**
   - Go to the `Prefabs` folder under `source/Prefabs` and drag the `ModMapManager` prefab into your scene.

5. **Base Setup:**
   - To set up a team base point, click the "Set Team Base" button and then click the area where you want the team's base to be. Players will automatically spawn close to this point in modes that require them to spawn at their base.
   - To set up a team flag point, click the "Set Team Flag" button and then click the area where you want the team's flag to be.

   **Note:** You'll need to set up the base and flag for both teams to avoid issues.
