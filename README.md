## Prerequisites
Before installing the Mod Tools in your Unity project, ensure the following packages are installed from the Package Manager to avoid compiler issues:
- `com.unity.ai.navigation`
- `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`
- `com.unity.postprocessing`

## Installation
To install the project, download the latest version from the [Releases](#) section.

## Usage

### Setting Up a Map

After installing the Unity package, follow these steps to set up and export your map:

1. **Open or Create a Scene:**
   - Open the scene with your map, or create a new scene and build the map you want to export.
   
2. **Ensure Proper Collider Setup:**
   - Make sure your map has all necessary colliders set up correctly.

3. **Add the ModMapManager Prefab:**
   - Go to the `Prefabs` folder under `source/Prefabs` and drag the `ModMapManager` prefab into your scene.

4. **Access Map Tools:**
   - Select the `ModMapManager` in the Hierarchy. You should see the Map Tools in the Inspector panel.

### Configuring the Map for Export

1. **General Setup:**
   - Expand the "General" section by clicking the arrow next to it.
   
   ![Open General](Documentation/Images/Open_General.jpg)

   a. **Edit Playable Area:**
      - Click the "Edit Area" button to enter Area Edit Mode. Use this tool to set the area on your map that players are allowed to access. Please set this area as small as possible to avoid precision issues.

      **Note:** Placing points requires the stage colliders to be set up.

   b. **Set Spawn Points:**
      - Select the "Edit SpawnPoints" button to enter SpawnPoints Mode. Left-click anywhere in the scene to place a spawn point. Right-click a spawn point to remove it.
      
      ![Place Spawn Points](Documentation/Images/PlaceSpawnPoints.gif)

   c. **Set Weapon Spawn Points:**
      - Select the "Edit WeaponsSpawnPoints" button to enter WeaponsSpawnPoints Mode. Left-click anywhere in the scene to place a weapon spawn point. Right-click a spawn point to remove it. Weapon spawns are crucial for Battle Royale mode.
      
      ![Place Weapon Spawn Points](Documentation/Images/PlaceWeaponSpawnPoints.gif)

   d. **Base Setup:**
      - To set up a team base point, click the "Set Team Base" button and then click the area where you want the team's base to be. Players will automatically spawn close to this point in modes that require them to spawn at their base.
      - To set up a team flag point, click the "Set Team Flag" button and then click the area where you want the team's flag to be.

      **Note:** You'll need to set up the base and flag for both teams to avoid issues.

   - When you are done with the general setup, you can minimize the foldout to make the scene look cleaner as you move to the next section.

2. **Bots Setup:** 
   - Expand the Bots Settings.
   - Click the "Edit BotsReferencePoints" button to edit the reference points for bots. These points are crucial for bots' navigation. Place them around corners, near windows, and in areas that bots can access. Place them only on floors and other reachable areas.

3. **Conquest Setup:** 
   - Expand the Conquest Settings to reveal the Conquest Setup. Enable Conquest by checking the "Enable Conquest" checkbox.
   
   ![Enable Conquest](Documentation/Images/EnableConquest.jpg)

   - The Conquest Radius slider controls the size of Conquest Objectives.
   - The Respawn Radius slider controls the radius within which the Conquest Objective will collect respawn points. This should be considerably larger than the Conquest Radius. Ensure respawn points are placed within the radius of each objective you add.
   - The "Conquest Only Objects" list contains stage objects that you want to load only in Conquest Mode. Add any object from the scene to the list, and they will be disabled in other modes.
   - To add a new Conquest Objective, click the "+" button.
   
   ![Add Conquest Objective](Documentation/Images/AddConquestObjective.jpg)

   - After adding the Conquest Objective, click the ![Move Button](Documentation/Images/MoveButton.jpg) button and tap where you want in the stage to move the objective to that point.
   
   ![Place Conquest Objective](Documentation/Images/PlaceConquestObjective.gif)

   - To remove a Conquest Objective, click the "-" button on the top right of the Objective Setup.
